WRANGLE AND ANALYZE DATA - TWITTER WeRateDogs


## INTRODUCTION

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. The account was started in 2015 by college student Matt Nelson, and has received international media attention both for its popularity and for the attention drawn to social media copyright law when it was suspended by Twitter for breaking these aforementioned laws.
WeRateDogs asks people to send photos of their dogs, then tweets selected photos rating and a humorous comment. Dogs are rated on a scale of one to ten, but are invariably given ratings in excess of the maximum, such as "13/10". Popular posts are re-posted on Instagram and Facebook. In 2017, Nelson started a spin-off Twitter account, Thoughts of Dog.
My main goal was: gather, assess and clean these data to analyze it better. Data had missing or incorrect information such as incorrect ratings or missing breeds of dog etc. To find out most favorited breed or best rated dog, I firstly assess and cleaned this data. Finally I shared results below.

Project includes 4 parts:
1. Gathering Data
2. Assesing Data
3. Cleaning Data
4. Analyzing Data

Research Titles:

1. Most Favorited Dog
2. Most Retweeted Dog
3. Distribution of Stage Of Dog Category
4. Distribution of Ratings
5. Distribution of Breeds


## RESULTS

It was interesting report for me to complete this project. Data was complicated and people usually did not follow rules to have clean data. There should be more tweets which are not even about dogs! But still report shows clear understanding for most favorited and retweeted tweets.
I tried to apply Twitter Developer account but it has been rejected by Twitter team. So I could not gather data from API.
